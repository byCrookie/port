# port

[![CI](https://github.com/kevinboss/port/actions/workflows/ci.yaml/badge.svg?event=push)](https://github.com/kevinboss/port/actions/workflows/ci.yaml)


## What is it?

port allows the user to configure multiple images and assign a readable identifier for each image.
Afterwards the user can run the images (this also shuts down any other running containers using a configured image), create snapshots of the running containers as well as remove the original image or snapshots.

## How to get it?

*Install using scoop*

`scoop bucket add maple 'https://github.com/kevinboss/maple.git'`

`scoop install port`

*Install manually*
