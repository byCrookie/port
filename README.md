## What is it

port is a tool that has been designed to manage multiple images and / or tags of these images.
It allows the user to run any of these images. It is then possible to create snapshots of the running containers, reset them and switch between snapshots.

## How to get it

### Install using [scoop](https://scoop.sh)

`scoop bucket add maple 'https://github.com/kevinboss/maple.git'`

`scoop install port`
